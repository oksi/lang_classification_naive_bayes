## Introduction
This is a practical part of the Coursera Guided Project created by the Coursera Project Network.

## Project Objectives
- Explore and visualize dataset to identify key issues in training data
- Preprocess and clean dataset using relevant methods
- Explore theory of Naive Bayes Modeling, and train first model
- Develop your approach using learned theory to improve performance
- Design new approach using subwords to mitigate class imbalance problems
